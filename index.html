            <aside>It's even more fucking perfect than the other motherfucking websites. And why is that, you fuck?</aside>

        <h2><strong>Hipstered domain extension and beautiful typography.</strong></h2>
        <p>We all know that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> ― <em>MFW</em> ― it's grotesque pile of shit. And we also know that <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">Better Motherfucking Website</a> ― <em>BMFW</em> ― improved the <i>Ass-Blastered Crap</i> into an (almost) easy-to-read masterpiece. But I made it even better! Like the other motherfucking websites, <strong>Even Better Motherfucking Website</strong> ― <em>EBMFW</em> ―, has all of the glory that the original, 'perfect-ass' website has - along with some improvements from the <em>BMFW</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast;</li>
            <li><em>Still</em> fits on all of your shitty screens;</li>
            <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all of your shitty browsers;</li>
            <li>This motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site;</li>
            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across;</li>
            <li><strong>Plus a hipstered domain extension and beautiful typography.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What about Comic Sans?</h2>
        <p>That really hurt! Who throws a shoe? Honestly?</p>
        <h2>Let it breathe even more</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married, they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash ― pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that... piss off. If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. Have you ever seen a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book."<br/>

        <p>I made it even better: <code>line-height: 1.8</code></p>
        <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole."<br>
            - <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com"><em>BMFW</em></a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I made it even better: <code>background: #f2f2f2</code><br/>Because I don't care about 7 fucking lines of declarations.</p>
        <h2>Yes, this continues to be fucking satirical, fuckers</h2>
        <p>Like the creator of <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">Better Motherfucking Website</a>, I ♥ what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> did. It's all about the message! But let's face it: would you rather have crap, or some beautifully-aligned shit?</p>
